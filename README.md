# Testing

Note 1: Github has one key, and this key is shared for every commit done on their website.

Note 2: Forking is required for random accounts to add things to GitHub accounts which blocks super obvious attacks that way, but if given write abilites or sneaking into a large github, could potentially slip by.

Note 3: Git can automatically assign someone's username and email. 

Note 4: Only the email matters when pushing a commit from a local machine. And github will register any changes to just the username.

Note 5: Withwrite access, direct manipulation is perfectly fine. So, this could allow attackers to infiltrate a group by doing minor fixes, and then to scramble the code(to cause delays/just rollback the commit) or inject negative code as an attack.
